The following module names map to optimization techniques:

constant folding:
	compress_add.py
	compress_boolean.py

algebraic simplification:
	eliminate_unneeded_unaries.py

boolean short circuiting:
	compress_boolean.py

conditional simplification:
	remove_dead_code.py

constant propagation:
	local_interpreter.py

The AST equivalent checker is in check_ast_equality.py. All of these modules are wrapped up in the optimize_pass.py.

# Python Compiler

This repository consists of two versions of a Python to x86 Compiler written in Python for a Compiler Construction class in Spring 2015.

# Pythontox86Compiler  
  This version consists of source code upto the homework assignment 6 of Compiler Construction class. That is it consists of the subsets P0, P1, P2 and P3 of the Python language subsets agreed upon in the class.
  
  Please visit the [course website] (https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~bec/courses/csci4555-s15/) for more information.

  Refer the [class notes] (https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~bec/courses/csci4555-s15/reading/notes.pdf) to understand the assignments and compiler functionality.
  
# Optimized Compiler
  This version includes compiler optimizations for constant folding, constant propagation, algebraic transformations and conditional simplifications on top of the Pythontox86Compiler designed for the class.
  
# Instructions to use the Compiler:
  - Clone the repository and change directory to any one of the versions of the compiler.
  - Refer Test-cases directory in each version and the class notes to understand the subsets of the language supported.
  - Run an example through the compiler by executing the run script (run.sh) with test file as an argument
    ./run.sh $test_file
  
# Credits
The compiler is a combined effort of [Aniket Lata](https://github.com/aniketalps) and Brandon Ruffin.
